# Abstract

Software is at the heart of modern academic science, but our institutions for 
education and research are undergoing growing pains concerning the proper care 
and feeding of software and software developers in the context of academia. 

Conducting open, reproducible, computational science in the domains involves 
many practical challenges.  Leading a software-development-focused research 
group in academia can be difficult to fund and manage with traditional 
strategies.  Similarly, programs for training students in the domain sciences 
to become effective computational researchers are rare, immature, untested, or 
untennable. Research leaders are also faced with challenges in software 
sustainability and are unprepared to develop the user-developer communities 
needed to sustain and improve their software in their scientific domain. 
Finally, efforts to improve the quality of scientific software through top-down 
pressure are hampered by publication venues (journals, etc.) hesitant to adopt 
and uphold stricter software quality requirements.

Software Carpentry, Lab Carpentry, The Hacker Within, and other 
initiatives are currently lowering the barriers for academics who produce 
software as part of their research work. However, more effort is needed to 
support a new generation of computationally fluent research teams.
